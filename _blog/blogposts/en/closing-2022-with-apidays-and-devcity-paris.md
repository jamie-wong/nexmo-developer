After the successful [DevCity San Francisco at Dreamforce](https://developer.vonage.com/blog/22/08/15/vonage-devrel-looks-ahead-to-a-better-than-ever-dreamforce) and [DevCity London](https://developer.vonage.com/blog/22/11/08/devcity-came-to-london-and-here-is-what-went-down), the Vonage Developer Relations team closed out the year at the [apidays conference ](https://www.apidays.global/paris/)with the final DevCity stop - Paris. 

## Apidays Paris

The conference was held on 14-16 December 2022 and attracted 1700 attendees. 

On opening day David Darmon, Vonage’s VP of Sales EMEA, took to the stage for a talk called "Become a Conversational Commerce Trailblazer – the Drive for CX Innovation". The room was so crowded that there were barely enough seats!

Vonage Developer Advocate, [Benjamin Aronov](https://developer.vonage.com/blog/authors/benjamin-aronov), ran a workshop titled ‘NoCode, LowCode, Boss Mode: Reimagining User Experience with AI Studio’ where participants left ready to build their first AI Studio agent after the session.
