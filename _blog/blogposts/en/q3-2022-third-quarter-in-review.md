It's hard for me to believe we're already 10 months in! As we approach the end of the year, it feels like the year has flown by.

Every month at Vonage counts, and the last three have been no exception. Here's what we've been up to.

### Enhanced Customer Engagement

**Vonage AI Studio**

Imagine if you could improve customer satisfaction by offering better conversation-based self-service to multiple customers at the same time. That's what the Vonage AI studio does.

The best part is you need little to no coding skills to get started. You can focus on designing the best conversation flows to engage your customers with the drag-and-drop interface. It is also possible to use AI Studio through different channels such as voice (telephone), WhatsApp, SMS, and any other channels by using the HTTP agent.

Our developer advocates have put together tutorials for different agent types to get you started.

[Karl Lingiah](https://developer.vonage.com/blog/authors/karl-lingiah) authored [a piece](https://developer.vonage.com/blog/22/08/02/choose-your-own-adventure-with-vonage-ai-studio) on using AI studio with voice as a channel (phone). **Hint:** You might want to read until the end if you are a fan of 'choose your own adventure' books.

[Michael Crump](https://developer.vonage.com/blog/authors/michael-crump) has one [using SMS as a channel](https://developer.vonage.com/blog/22/09/13/if-you-can-point-and-click-then-you-can-make-a-conversational-ai) and if you are interested in using AI studio with WhatsApp as a channel  Sejal D'souza covers this in her [crash course](https://developer.vonage.com/blog/22/09/01/crash-course-create-virtual-agents-for-whatsapp-with-vonage-ai-studio) as well.

Also, you no longer have to wait! With Vonage AI Studio out of Developer Preview and generally available, you can [sign up](https://studio.ai.vonage.com/) and get started right away.

**Firebase Video Extension**

On the topic of improving customer engagement, video is one of the most effective ways to engage customers deeply, whether through product demonstrations, conversations, or support.

This is why we are happy to announce our [Firebase multiparty video extension](https://extensions.dev/extensions/vonage/firestore-vonage-video-express). The extension created by our Javascript Developer Advocate [Dwane Hemmings](https://developer.vonage.com/blog/authors/dwanehemmings) makes it easy to build a multi-participant ie: conferencing video app using the Firebase platform. To get started check out the extension on the [Firebase Marketplace](https://extensions.dev/extensions/vonage/firestore-vonage-video-express).

### In the world of SDKsâ€¦

**Messages API**

SDKs, what will we do without them? I will tell you, we will be wasting time writing wrapper code. This is why our Developer Relations Tooling Team provides SDKs for our APIs, and the newest API to be added to our SDKs is the [Messages API](https://developer.vonage.com/blog/22/07/05/the-vonage-messages-api-is-now-in-our-server-sdks).

Speaking of the benefits of going beyond APIs and providing customers with SDKs, [Sina Madani](https://developer.vonage.com/blog/authors/sina-madani) our Java Developer Advocate wrote [a post](https://developer.vonage.com/blog/22/08/04/how-an-sdk-can-add-value-to-rest-apis) on the subject using the [Messages API](https://developer.vonage.com/messages/overview) as an example.

**SDK Releases**

It's time to get rid of the old and bring in the new. We released major Ruby and Java SDK updates, including improvements, fixes, and deprecations.


You can find details on what's changed in the [Ruby v3](https://developer.vonage.com/blog/22/08/08/announcing-python-sdk-version-v3) and [Java v7](https://developer.vonage.com/blog/22/08/22/announcing-the-vonage-java-sdk-v7-0-0) release posts.

**The V-app**

Do you know what is better than SDKs? Demo apps showing SDKs in action. Let me introduce you to the [V-app](https://github.com/nexmo-community/clientsdk-the-v-app) a multi-platform (iOS, Android, Web) demo app that demonstrates the implementation of voice and messaging functionalities.

Here is [a post](https://developer.vonage.com/blog/22/08/25/introducing-the-vonage-client-sdk-v-app-demo-projects
) put together by [Abdul Ajetunmobi](https://developer.vonage.com/blog/authors/abdul-ajetunmobi) our Senior Developer Advocate to walk you through the codebase and get you started.

### Let's Connect!
