After the launch of [DevCity at Dreamforce in San Francisco](https://developer.vonage.com/blog/22/08/15/vonage-devrel-looks-ahead-to-a-better-than-ever-dreamforce), the Developer Relations team at Vonage are excited to share that the event series is coming to [London on Wednesday 26th October](https://events.vonage.com/DevCityLondon)! Read on to find out how you can get involved in the latest Developer hangout on the block. 

## What Is DevCity?

Hosted by the Vonage Developer Relations team, the DevCity event series brings together engaging content, international networking, exclusive swag and lots of fun and games - all tailored for developers. Whether you’re new on the Dev scene or super experienced, there is something for you. 

Featuring a mix of Vonage speakers and special guests, the DevCity content will equip you with everything you need to know about integrating our Communications APIs into your projects - be it voice, video, SMS or verify. We’ll also be meeting happy Vonage customers, analysing the latest trends and demonstrating first-hand how you can supercharge your communications. 

Come for the tech, but stay for the party - we’ll be offering a unique range of experiences, games and competitions, as well as the chance for you to get your hands on the latest swag that everyone’s talking about. 

## Sounds Great! Here is the Plan for London:

DevCity London puts a new twist on an old favourite - bingo night! Join us at [Dabbers Social Bingo](https://dabbers.bingo/) from 6pm till 10 pm BST on Wednesday 26th October, where we’ll be serving up fresh content, delicious food and yummy cocktails. 

On the mic will be [Chris Tankersley](https://developer.vonage.com/blog/authors/christankersley), Vonage’s Senior Dev Relations Engineer, giving you the low down on the Vonage APIs, followed by [Zachary Powell](https://developer.vonage.com/blog/authors/zachary-powell-1), Senior Android Developer Advocate and [Ashley Arthur](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ash30/), Node.js Developer, who will be talking about how Vonage moved its Client SDKs to Kotlin Multiple Platform and the benefits and challenges encountered along the way, as well as a special customer story. 

After the talks, it's bingo time! With great prizes to be won and unique challenges to conquer, you’ll be grabbing your dabber and getting stuck in while the DJ blasts great tunes.
