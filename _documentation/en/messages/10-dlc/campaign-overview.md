# 10 DLC Campaigns Overview

Campaigns allow carriers to determine the purpose of the messages originating from the numbers assigned to that campaign. Campaigns have a minimum duration of three months. They do not expire until cancelled, and are billed monthly after the first three months. The TCR does not allow for refunds, so when cancelling a campaign, we will keep it active until the end of the period already paid. Campaign applications are sent to all US carriers for approval. Once they have all approved the campaign (which can take up to 7 days), you can link numbers to the campaign.

Campaigns contain information such as:

* Campaign name (label) & description.
* Use case.
* Throughput qualifications agreed for each carrier.
* Sample messages (used by carriers to check adherence to the use case).
* Subscribers opt-in/out records (requirement of 10DLC for most campaigns).
* Number(s) linked to the campaign.
* Other features (age gate, number pooling, linksâ€”requires vetting, controlled content).

In this section, you will learn about:

* [Campaign types](#campaign-types)

* [Subscriber information and message content](#subscriber-information-and-message-content)

## Campaign types

There are two types of campaigns:

* **Standard campaigns:** Basic use cases that usually do not require additional review. 
* **Special campaigns:** Use cases that require additional brand vetting or pre/post Mobile Network Operator (MNO) approval. Some use cases require preapproval from Vonage (i.e. Social Media). Requirements for special campaigns differ from use case to use case and registration may require more time.
