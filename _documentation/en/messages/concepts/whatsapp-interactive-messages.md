# WhatsApp Interactive Messages

In May 2021 Facebook added a new feature in WhatsApp for Business: **Interactive Messages**. Interactive Messages allow businesses to streamline interactions with their customers. Using Interactive Messages provides benefits for both customers and developers. Clear and specific options provide a better end-user experience, which can lead to better engagement and response rates. Precise replies from end users with developer-friendly IDs, make it simpler to design business logic or integrate with chatbots.

The Vonage Messages API v1 supports three types of Interactive Messages:

- List Messages
- Reply Buttons
- Product Messages

## List Messages

List messages provide a simpler and more consistent way for users to make a selection from multiple options when interacting with a business. Messages include a menu of up to 10 options in pop-up list format.

One possible use-case for reply buttons might be a customer choosing between a selection of possible actions.

## Reply Buttons

Reply buttons provide a quick way for users to make a selection from a menu when interacting with a business. Messages can include up to 3 options, where each option is presented as a button.

One possible use-case for reply buttons might be a customer choosing between a selection of options in the context of a particular action.
