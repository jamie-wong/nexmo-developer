# Payments over the Phone

There are various scenarios when you may want to charge the user during the phone call, for example, automated order processing, subscription renewal, debt collection. To do that securely with credit cards, the application which deals with sensitive card data (numbers, expiration dates, security codes) must follow PCI compliance rules. Vonage Voice API provides you with the option to seamlessly embed secure payment processing into the call flow using the [NCCO](/voice/voice-api/guides/ncco) syntax.


## Preliminary Configuration

### Payment Gateway Configuration

To enable payments with Stripe using Vonage, please login to the Vonage Customer Dashboard and proceed to the [Integrations section](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/integrations).

![Dashboard Integrations](/images/voice-api/dashboard-integrations.png)

In the integrations section select *Stripe Connect*.

A popup should show asking you to provide a name for this integration. After entering the name press "Connect with Stripe Connect" button.

After being redirected to Stripe's page, please go through all the necessary activation steps.

Once finished return back to Vonage.

### Voice Application Configuration

Having completed the Payment Gateway integration, it is now necessary to enable a Vonage Application to use this integration.

If you don't have an Application, create one via the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/applications/new) or one of our tools (curl, CLI, Server SDKs).

When creating an application via the Dashboard, or edit if you already have an application you want to work with, please enable Voice capabilities:

![Dashboard > New Application > Capabilities](/images/voice-api/dashboard-application-capabilities-voice.png)

Next, click on 'Show Advanced Features', enable 'Payments over Phone' and select a Stripe account:

> Switch to Live mode when you have finished the testing and are ready to accept real card payments.

## Pay Action

To start the secure payment IVR, use the `pay` [NCCO action](/voice/voice-api/guides/ncco):

```json
[
  {
     "action": "pay",
     "amount": 9.99
  }
]
```

> The `pay` action supported for inbound calls only. 

> Only Mastercard and Visa cards supported.

This will trigger the IVR flow with the following prompts:
- *Please enter your long card number*
- *Please enter your four-digit credit card expiration date*
- *Please enter your three-digit credit card security code*

In case the user enters the card data correctly, they will be charged $9.99, and your application will get the following callback:

```json
{
  from: '15551234567',
  to: '15557654321',
  type: 'payment',
  uuid: '041f4dffd9f4aa932512dd55e3abc123',
  conversation_uuid: 'CON-0e4a51ee-af50-41aa-bd2d-4e895edef456',
  status: 'success',
  timestamp: '2021-06-23T15:27:46.479Z'
}
```

and you will see the transaction in your [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/).

> `pay` action is only applicable for inbound calls and the first [leg of the conversation](/voice/voice-api/guides/legs-conversations) (the inbound one).

If the user doesn't enter the card number, expiration date, or security code within 10 seconds, the prompt will be played one more time giving the user another try. If the user enters any of the card information incorrectly or doesn't enter anything after the second prompt, the following callback is sent to the application:

```json
{
  from: '15551234567',
  to: '15557654321',
  type: 'payment',
  uuid: '041f4dffd9f4aa932512dd55e3abc123',
  conversation_uuid: 'CON-0e4a51ee-af50-41aa-bd2d-4e895edef456',
  status: 'failure',
  timestamp: '2021-06-23T15:27:46.479Z'
}
```

You can configure the following parameters of the `pay` action.

### Event URL

Similarly to other actions, you can set a custom URL for the `pay` action status event by using `eventUrl` parameter:

```json
[
  {
     "action": "pay",
     "amount": 9.99,
     "eventUrl": [ "https://www.example.com/webhooks/pay"]
  }
]
```

### Amount

Set the `amount` to be charged as in the sample above.

### Currency

US dollar is used as the currency by default. Use `currency` parameter to select the required one:

```json
[
  {
     "action": "pay",
     "amount": 9.99,
     "currency": "gbp",
     "eventUrl": [ "https://www.example.com/webhooks/pay"]
  }
]
```

    "amount": 9.99,
    "prompts": [
      {
        "type": "CardNumber",
        "text": "Your custom prompt for card number",
        "errors": {
          "InvalidCardType": {
            "text": "The type of your credit card is not supported. Please try another one"
          },
          "InvalidCardNumber": {
            "text": "Invalid credit card number. Please try again"
          },
          "Timeout": {
            "text": "Please enter your long credit card number"
          }
        }
      },
      {
        "type": "ExpirationDate",
        "text": "Please enter expiry date",
        "errors": {
          "InvalidExpirationDate": {
            "text": "Invalid expiration date. Please try again"
          },
          "Timeout": {
            "text": "Please enter your 4-digit credit card expiration date"
          }
        }
      },
      {
        "type": "SecurityCode",

            "text": "Invalid security code. Please try again"
          },
          "Timeout": {
            "text": "Please enter your 3-digit credit card security code"
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
]
```
