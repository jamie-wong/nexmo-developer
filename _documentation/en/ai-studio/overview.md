# Vonage AI Studio

[Vonage AI Studio](https://www.vonage.com/communications-apis/ai-studio/?icmp=l3nav|l3nav_gototheaistudiooverviewpage_novalue) is a low-code / no-code solution for building complex conversational flows. The flows are implemented via a drag-and-drop interface based on the concept of a Canvas to which you add conversation Nodes. The Nodes are connected together to form the business logic for the conversational flow.

There are multiple different types of Node, each of which performs a specific role or action within the overall conversational flow.
