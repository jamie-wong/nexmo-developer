# Delivery receipts

When you make a successful request to the SMS API, it returns an array of `message` objects, one for each message. Ideally these will have a `status` of `0`, indicating success. But this does not mean that your message has reached your recipients. It only means that your message has been successfully queued for sending.

Vonage's [adaptive routing](https://help.nexmo.com/hc/en-us/articles/218435987-What-is-Nexmo-Adaptive-Routing-) then identifies the best carrier for your message. When the selected carrier has delivered the message, it returns a *delivery receipt* (DLR).

To receive DLRs in your application, you must provide a [webhook](/concepts/guides/webhooks) for Vonage to send them to. Alternatively, you could use the [Reports API](/reports/overview) to periodically download your records, including per-message delivery status.

> **Note**: In most situations, a DLR is a reliable indicator that a message was delivered. However, it is not an absolute guarantee. See [how delivery receipts work](#how-delivery-receipts-work).

## How delivery receipts work

```sequence_diagram
participant Your Application
participant Vonage
participant Carrier
participant Handset

Your Application->>Vonage: Send an SMS
Vonage->>Carrier: SMS
Carrier->>Handset: SMS
Handset->>Carrier: Delivery Receipt
Carrier->>Vonage: Delivery Receipt
Vonage->>Your Application: Delivery Receipt Webhook
```

Delivery receipts are either:

* **Carrier** - returned when the service provider receives the message
* **Handset** - returned when the user's handset receives the message

Not all DLRs guarantee that the target received your message. Some delivery receipts represent successful completion of only one stage in the delivery process, such as passing the message to another operator. Other delivery receipts are fakes. Because of this, Vonage cannot completely guarantee that a DLR is accurate. It depends on the [countries](/messaging/sms/guides/country-specific-features) you are sending messages to and the providers involved.

If your message is longer than can be sent in a single SMS, the messages are [concatenated](/messaging/sms/guides/concatenation-and-encoding). You should receive a carrier DLR for each part of the concatenated SMS. Handset DLRs for a concatenated message are delayed. This is because the target handset has to process each part of the concatenated message before it can acknowledge receipt of the full message.

## Understanding the delivery receipt

This is a typical DLR:

```json
{
  "err-code": "0",
  "message-timestamp": "2018-10-25 12:10:29",
  "messageId": "0B00000127FDBC63",
  "msisdn": "447547232824",
  "network-code": "23410",
  "price": "0.03330000",
  "scts": "1810251310",
  "status": "delivered",
  "to": "Vonage"
}
```

The most important fields are `status` and `err-code` as these tell you whether your message was delivered and, if not, what went wrong.

### DLR status messages

The `status` field in the DLR tells you if your SMS was delivered successfully. Possible values are:

| `status`    | Description                                                                                             |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `accepted`  | Message has been accepted for delivery, but has not yet been delivered                                  |
| `delivered` | Message has been delivered                                                                              |
| `buffered`  | Message has been buffered for later delivery                                                            |
| `expired`   | Message was held at downstream carrier's retry scheme and could not be delivered within the expiry time |
| `failed`    | Message not delivered                                                                                   |
| `rejected`  | Downstream carrier refuses to deliver message                                                           |
| `unknown`   | No useful information available                                                                         |


### DLR error codes

The `err-code` field in the DLR provides more detailed information and can help troubleshoot a failed delivery. A non-zero code indicates that the message could not be delivered.

| `err-code` | Meaning                       | Description                                                                                                                                  |

## Using the SMS API in campaigns

Before you start your messaging campaign, check the [country specific features guide](/messaging/sms/guides/country-specific-features) for the countries you are sending to. If the country you are sending to does not supply reliable DLRs, use the [Conversion API](/messaging/conversion-api/overview) to provide Vonage with more data points and ensure the best routing.

Optionally, you can identify specific customers or campaigns by including a reference with each message you send. These are included in the delivery receipt. Pass your chosen reference into the request by specifying a `client-ref` parameter of up to 40 characters.
