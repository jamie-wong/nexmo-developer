# Meetings API Callbacks

API meetings callbacks allow you to receive information about session events, participant activity, recording details, and room expiration.

> To configure callbacks, enable the Meetings API capability in your application via the [Vonage API Dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com).

## Types of Callbacks

The following table describe each type of callback notification:

Name | Description |
-- | -- | -- |
``room:expired`` | The room is inactive. Sessions cannot be created for inactive rooms.
``session:started`` | A session has started.
``session:ended`` | A session has finished.
``recording:started`` | A recording is beginning within a session.
``recording:ended`` | A recording has been stopped within a session.
``recording:uploaded`` | A recording is ready to be downloaded.
``participant:joined`` | Someone has joined a session.
``session:participant:left`` | Someone has left a session.
